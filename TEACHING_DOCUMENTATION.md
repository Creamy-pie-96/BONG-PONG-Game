# Pong Game - Teaching Documentation

## Overview

This Pong game is designed as an educational project demonstrating game development concepts in Godot Engine. The project includes multiple game modes, AI systems, physics, settings management, and user interface design.

## Recent Updates

### New Features Added

1. **Side Selection for Single Player** - Choose to play as left or right paddle
2. **AI vs AI Mode** - Watch two AIs battle with independent difficulty settings
3. **Corrected Gravity Physics** - Now uses realistic Earth gravity (9.8 m/s²)
4. **Enhanced AI System** - Independent AI difficulties and strategic behaviors

## Game Modes

### 1. Single Player Mode

**What it teaches:** Game state management, AI implementation, user choice handling

**How it works:**

1. Player selects "Single Player" from main menu
2. Side selection screen appears with "Play as Left" and "Play as Right" options
3. GameState stores the player's choice and sets up the game accordingly
4. AI controls the opposite paddle using difficulty setting from Settings menu

**Key Learning Points:**

- Global state management using singletons
- Scene transitions and data passing
- Conditional logic based on user choices

### 2. AI vs AI Mode

**What it teaches:** Advanced AI systems, independent parameter management, UI design

**How it works:**

1. Player selects "AI vs AI" from main menu
2. Setup screen allows setting different difficulties for each AI (0-100%)
3. Both AIs use the same strategic algorithms but with different skill levels
4. Real-time percentage displays show current difficulty settings

**Key Learning Points:**

- Multiple AI instances with different parameters
- Real-time UI updates
- Slider controls and data binding

### 3. Multiplayer Mode

**What it teaches:** Input mapping, local multiplayer implementation

**How it works:**

- Both players use keyboard controls
- Player 1: W-A-S-D for movement, Q-E for rotation
- Player 2: 8-4-2-6 (numpad) for movement, 7-9 for rotation
- No AI involvement - pure human vs human gameplay

## Physics System

### Gravity Implementation

**What it teaches:** Physics simulation, realistic game mechanics

```gdscript
# ball.gd - Corrected gravity implementation
var gravity_strength = 9.8  # Earth gravity in m/s²

func apply_gravity(delta):
    # Apply gravity based on current direction
    if linear_velocity.y > 0:  # Ball moving down
        linear_velocity.y += gravity_strength * delta
    else:  # Ball moving up
        linear_velocity.y -= gravity_strength * delta
```

**Key Learning Points:**

- Real-world physics integration
- Delta time usage for frame-rate independence
- Conditional physics application

### Bounce System

**What it teaches:** Physics materials, collision response

```gdscript
# Bounce multiplier tied to gravity for consistent physics
var bounce_multiplier = gravity_strength  # 9.8 for realistic feel
```

**Key Learning Points:**

- Physics material configuration
- Consistent physics scaling
- Realistic ball behavior

---

## AI System Architecture

### Difficulty Scaling

**What it teaches:** Parameter interpolation, AI behavior design

```gdscript
# GameState.gd - Difficulty parameter calculation
func get_ai_precision_for_difficulty(difficulty: float) -> float:
    return 0.1 + (difficulty * 0.9)  # 10% to 100% accuracy

func get_ai_reaction_time_for_difficulty(difficulty: float) -> float:
    return 0.5 - (difficulty * 0.45)  # 0.5s to 0.05s reaction time
```

**Key Learning Points:**

- Linear interpolation for smooth difficulty scaling
- Human-like AI behavior simulation
- Performance vs realism trade-offs

### State Machine Implementation

**What it teaches:** AI state management, strategic thinking

```gdscript
# AI States: TRACKING, INTERCEPTING, REPOSITIONING
match ai_state:
    "TRACKING":
        if ball_approaching and ball_pos.x > 640:
            ai_state = "INTERCEPTING"
    "INTERCEPTING":
        if not ball_approaching or ball_pos.x < 640:
            ai_state = "REPOSITIONING"
```

**Key Learning Points:**

- State machine pattern
- Conditional state transitions
- Strategic AI behavior

---

## Settings System

### Configuration Management

**What it teaches:** Data persistence, user preferences

**Features:**

- Sound volume controls (Music/SFX)
- Physics settings (Ball Speed/Gravity)
- AI difficulty for single player
- Settings saved to config file

**Key Learning Points:**

- ConfigFile usage in Godot
- Signal-based UI updates
- Real-time settings application

### UI Design Patterns

**What it teaches:** User interface best practices

**Elements:**

- Sliders with percentage labels
- Real-time value updates
- Modal dialog patterns
- Consistent styling

## Code Organization

### Singleton Pattern (GameState)

**What it teaches:** Global state management, design patterns

```gdscript
# GameState.gd - Accessible from any scene
extends Node

var is_multiplayer: bool = true
var is_ai_vs_ai: bool = false
var player_side: String = "left"
var ai_difficulty: float = 0.5
```

**Benefits:**

- Centralized game state
- Easy access from any scene
- Persistent data across scene changes

### Scene Structure

**What it teaches:** Project organization, modular design

```
