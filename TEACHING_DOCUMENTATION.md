var gravity_strength = 9.8  # Earth gravity in m/s² (scientifically accurate!)

func apply_gravity(delta):
    # Apply gravity based on current ball direction
    if linear_velocity.y > 0:  # Ball moving downward
        linear_velocity.y += gravity_strength * delta
    else:  # Ball moving upward
        linear_velocity.y -= gravity_strength * delta
```

**Line-by-Line Teaching Points:**

func get_ai_precision_for_difficulty(difficulty: float) -> float:
    return 0.1 + (difficulty * 0.9)  # 10% to 100% accuracy

func get_ai_reaction_time_for_difficulty(difficulty: float) -> float:
    return 0.5 - (difficulty * 0.45)  # 0.5s to 0.05s reaction time
```

**Line-by-Line Teaching Points:**

1. **`return 0.1 + (difficulty * 0.9)`**

   - **Mathematical scaling:** Linear interpolation between minimum and maximum values
   - **Why not 0 to 100%:** Even "easy" AI should work somewhat (10% minimum)
   - **Psychology:** Players feel better beating AI that at least tries

2. **`return 0.5 - (difficulty * 0.45)`**
   - **Inverse relationship:** Higher difficulty = lower reaction time (faster reactions)
   - **Human-like ranges:** 0.5 seconds = slow human, 0.05 seconds = superhuman
   - **Why subtract:** Creates intuitive difficulty scaling

**Mathematical Understanding:**

- **Easy (0%):** 10% accuracy, 0.5s reaction = Beatable, human-like
- **Medium (50%):** 55% accuracy, 0.275s reaction = Challenging but fair
- **Hard (100%):** 100% accuracy, 0.05s reaction = Very difficult, near-perfect

**Key Learning Points:**

- **Linear interpolation** for smooth parameter scaling
- **Human-like AI behavior** simulation
- **Mathematical modeling** of difficulty
- **Psychology of game balance** and player satisfaction

match ai_state:
    "TRACKING":
        # Casual ball following when ball is far away
        if ball_approaching and ball_pos.x > screen_center_x:
            ai_state = "INTERCEPTING"  # Switch to active mode

    "INTERCEPTING":
        # Active prediction and interception when ball approaches
        if not ball_approaching or ball_pos.x < screen_center_x:
            ai_state = "REPOSITIONING"  # Switch to defensive mode

    "REPOSITIONING":
        # Move to strategic position when ball is moving away
        if ball_approaching and ball_pos.x > screen_center_x:
            ai_state = "TRACKING"  # Return to following mode
```

**Teaching Points:**

1. **State Machine Concept:**

   - **Human analogy:** Like different "moods" or "focuses" the AI can be in
   - **Strategic thinking:** AI behaves differently based on game situation
   - **Efficiency:** Only uses complex calculations when needed

2. **Transition Logic:**
   - **Condition-based switching:** AI changes behavior based on ball position/direction
   - **Strategic awareness:** AI knows when to be aggressive vs defensive
   - **Realistic behavior:** Mimics how human players think and react

**State Explanations:**

- **TRACKING:** "Ball is far away, I'll just follow it casually"
- **INTERCEPTING:** "Ball is coming to me, I need to predict where to hit it"
- **REPOSITIONING:** "Ball is going away, I'll move to a good defensive position"

**Key Learning Points:**

- **State machine pattern** for AI decision-making
- **Conditional state transitions** based on game conditions
- **Strategic AI behavior** that adapts to situations
- **Performance optimization** through selective computation

    emit_signal("music_volume_changed", music_volume)        # Notify other systems
    update_percentage_display("MusicVolumePercent", music_volume)  # Update UI
    save_setting()                                           # Save immediately!

func save_setting():
    var config = ConfigFile.new()

        # Special handling for ball speed (50% to 150% range)
        if label_name == "BallSpeedPercent":
            percentage = int(round(50 + (value * 100)))  # More intuitive range
        else:
            percentage = int(round(value * 100))         # Standard 0-100%

        label.text = str(percentage) + "%"  # Immediate visual feedback
```

**Teaching Points:**

1. **Real-time Feedback:**

   - **Immediate response:** UI updates as user interacts
   - **Clear information:** Exact percentages shown, not just slider position
